B. Title of Proposal:

Advance Facial Recognition Attendance System Software

C. Problem Statement: 

There is many attendance system offline and virtual. But using face detection feature is very less. So I will Build a System Which will take Attendance Based on  Face  Recognition.


(II)	Components Required/ Technology Frameworks/ Platforms 
Language: Python
Library: OpenCV, Tkinkter, numpy
Database:  mysql
(III)	 Algorithm/Flowchart/System Workflow 
   a. HaarCascade algorithm
   b. LBPH algorithm 
(IV)	Working Principle 
  After entering all details in “ Student details “ section , we can take the photos
  Of student (100 photos per student will be generated) which will save under  “data” folder and then we train the data in “Train Data” Section. After Clicking the   Face Recognizer Button Under “Face Detector “ Section we can show the student                 status (i.e., ID, Name, Roll No. ) . after that . it can automatically save the attendance   in” Sid.csv” File. This is how it will take attendance based on face recognition
(V)	Analysis and Discussion
Declared After completion  
(VI)	Novelty/USP of the solution 
 The system Detect the face and then take the attendance
(VII)	Which United Nation’s SDG your solution is addressing?
4 (Quality Education)

G. Results/Expected Outcomes: 
 
Student details window

 
Recognition window

 
100 samples of Images of a student
 
Taking Imsges

 
Training data Set
 
Showing student status


H. Risk and Mitigation Plan: 

I. Revenue Outcome/Business Plan: 
J. Conclusion and Future Work: 
   
          If I can add more features on this system , I will also provide them based on demand in future.
